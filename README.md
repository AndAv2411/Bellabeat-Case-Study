# 🏃‍♀️ Bellabeat Case Study: Wellness Data Analysis

## 📜 Project Overview

## 🎯 Business Task
Analyze smart device usage data to gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and apply these trends to Bellabeat's marketing strategy, focusing on the *Leaf* tracker and the *Bellabeat App*.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
The analysis was performed entirely in **R** using the following libraries:
* **tidyverse:** For data manipulation and wrangling.
* **ggplot2:** For data visualization.
* **janitor:** For data cleaning and column standardization.
* **lubridate:** For date/time formatting.

## 📊 Key Findings & Analysis
After processing the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (Public Domain), the following trends were identified:

### 1. Sedentary Lifestyle vs. Sleep Quality
There is a clear **negative correlation** between sedentary minutes and sleep duration. Users who spend more time inactive during the day tend to sleep less at night.
* *Average Sedentary Time:* 712 minutes (~11.8 hours/day).
* *Average Sleep:* 419 minutes (~7 hours).

### 2. Device Usage Consistency
* **30% of users** (9 out of 33) stop using the tracking device at night. This presents a massive opportunity to market a more comfortable device for sleep tracking.

### 3. Activity Levels
* Users average **8,515 steps**, falling short of the standard 10,000-step health recommendation.

## 📈 Visualizations
*(Note for Andrés: Here you can upload the images generated by your R code)*

> **Insight:** As shown in the analysis, higher sedentary time is linked to reduced sleep quality.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations (Act Phase)
Based on the data, I propose the following strategies for the marketing team:

1.  **"Rest via Movement" Smart Alerts:** Implement app notifications that encourage short walks after long periods of inactivity, educating users on how this improves sleep quality.
2.  **"Comfort That Never Sleeps" Campaign:** Target the 30% of users who remove devices at night by highlighting Bellabeat Leaf's comfortable design (clip/necklace) compared to bulky wristbands.
3.  **Gamification of Micro-Habits:** Instead of a daunting 10,000-step goal, introduce challenges that reward breaking up sedentary blocks every 2 hours.
